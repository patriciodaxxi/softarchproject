# HashBrown CMS
A free and open-source CMS built with Node.js and MongoDB

## The centralised approach
Ever wonder why you have to run a completely separate CMS for every single project? We did too, and that's why HashBrown exists today. This is the new central brain for your extended project structure.

## Installing and running HashBrown
First make sure you have these dependencies met:  
- node.js >= v6 
- mongodb >= v3.2  

Then checkout and run HashBrown:  
```
git clone https://github.com/Putaitu/hashbrown-cms.git -b stable --single-branch
cd ./hashbrown-cms
npm install
node hashbrown.js
```
